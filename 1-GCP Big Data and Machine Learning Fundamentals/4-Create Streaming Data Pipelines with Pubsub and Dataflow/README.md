# Description of Create Streaming Data Pipelines with Cloud Pub/sub and Cloud Dataflow

In this module you will engineer and build an auto-scaling streaming data pipeline to ingest, process, and visualize data on a dashboard. Before you build your pipeline you'll learn the foundations of message-oriented architecture and pitfalls to avoid when designing and implementing modern data pipelines.

## KEY CONCEPTS

* Identify modern data pipeline challenges and how to solve them at scale with Cloud Dataflow
* Design streaming pipelines with Apache Beam
* Build collaborative real-time dashboards with Data Studio
